# Basic Image Classification for Tree Species (Bark) using SVM Classifier

Here I am providing a basic script for image classification of tree species based on bark images using an SVM classifier. Please note that this script is intended for understanding the process involved in species classification, so accuracy may not be optimal. To achieve better accuracy, additional modifications and optimizations may be necessary.
